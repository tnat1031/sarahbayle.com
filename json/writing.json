The e-book was part of a multipronged content development strategy designed to drive inbound traffic to the new site. Another aspect of the strategy was to post shorter \"teaser\" pieces to social media. I condensed the e-book into a 10-point tipsheet, which was released in two parts on LinkedIn, further leveraging the value of the content.
