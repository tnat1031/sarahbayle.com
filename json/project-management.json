		"description": "<p>As a Production Editor, I work on full curriculum solutions for the career and postsecondary educational markets. This means that in addition to being responsible for cultivating and maintaining author and vendor relationships throughout the more traditional book production process, I also manage the production of digital assets for Jones & Bartlett Learning's Navigate 2 platform. For both print and digital production, I manage the schedules, vendors, and budgets.<\/p><p>Navigate 2, launched in 2014, is a fully hosted and supported online learning solution delivered through Moodle. Some of the tasks involved with creating a Navigate 2 course include hiring and managing assessment authors and copyeditors, as well as working in our partner vendor’s proprietary CMS to finalize assessments; gathering other course assets (e.g., slide decks, lecture outlines, discussion questions, animations, ebook files, etc.) and overseeing their integration with the Moodle platform; initiating course builds by liaising with our solutions team; and alpha and beta testing a course before its release.<\/p><p>For example, I recently managed the production of the fifth edition of <a href=\"http://www.jblearning.com/catalog/9781284048865\">Health Policy and Politics<\/a> by Jeri A. Milstead, a key title on the nursing list. I am also overseeing the creation of the companion <a href=\"http://www.jblearning.com/catalog/9781284068238\">Navigate 2 course<\/a>, which goes live in mid-January.",
